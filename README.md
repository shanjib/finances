# finances

I view my personal finances through a cash flow lens.
I know my bills for the next month, and set that money aside. I mark out the cash flow for the bills, paying it out of known accounts (savings accounts and good cash back credit cards).
I write down my spending as it happens, and mark down when I'll pay my credit card bill at the end of the month (I prefer to enter calendar months with 0 balance, regardless of statement cycle).
Based on my estimated future cash flow, after paying bills and credit cards, tells me how much cash I have leftover to spend on personal things.
